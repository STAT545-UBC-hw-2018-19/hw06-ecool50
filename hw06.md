# Introduction

In this assignment, I will attempt to do the following tasks:

* Writing functions that are useful to analyze the gapminder dataset
* Work with a nested data frame

## Load in required libraries

First we will load in all the libraries we will be using for this assignment.
```{r}
library(gapminder)
suppressMessages(library("tidyverse"))
library(knitr)
library(reshape2)
```


## Part 1: Writing Functions


### For this section, I will do the following:

* Create a function that takes in a year and produces a plot of the correlation between all the variables in that year
* Fit a model model linear model that predicts `life expectancy` for a given `year` and `gdpPercap` for a given country using a specific power $p$

```{r Create Correlation Function}
corr_plot <- function(Year){
#select the data for a give year
year_data <- filter(gapminder, year == year)

#compute the correlaton for this new dataset
corr_mat <- rcorr(year_data)

#we can also compute a heatmap of the correlation values
melted_corr_mat <- melt(corr_mat$r)
corr_plot <- ggplot(data = corr_mat_melted, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile(paste('Correlation between variables for year: ', Year))

# we can also compute the pvals associated with each correlation
pvals <- corr_mat$p

#return the correlation plot as well as the pval in list form
return(list(corr_plot, pvals)
}

```

```{r Create a function that fits a linear model}
fit_model <- function(Country, power, variable){
#extract the data for the specific country
data_country <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == Country)

#fit the model
model_fit  <- lm(lifeExp ~ poly(variable, power), data_country)

#we can print out a summary
summary(model_fit)

#compute the coefficients
setNames(coef(model_fit), c("intercept", "slope"))

#we can also compute the AIC and BIC to assess the model fit
return(list(AIC(model_fit), BIC(model_fit))
}

```
